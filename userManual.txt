2-Dimensional Physics Simulation 
User Manual

Placing Objects:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To place an object in the simulation, click the Place Objects button. The placement will default to ball, but a ramp can be placed if the Ramp button is clicked. The outline of the object being placed will show when the mouse hovers over the simulation window. Left-click the mouse to place the object. To cancel the placement, right-click the mouse anywhere or click the Cancel button.


Simulation Control:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reset: Returns all objects to their initial positions.
Clear: Removes all objects from the simulation.
Undo: Removes the most recently placed object.
Place Object: Place an object.
Start Simulation: Begin the simulation.
Stop Simulation: Stop the simulation.


Simulation Settings:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gravity: The force of gravity present in the simulation. Negative values will force objects downward. Positive values will force objects upward.
Air Density: The density of the air in the simulation. Higher values increase wind resistance. Value cannot be negative
Elastic Collisions: If selected, objects will never lose momentum when colliding.


Object Settings:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ball:
Mass: How heavy the object is in kilograms.
Radius: How large the radius of the ball is in meters.
Force Magnitude: The initial net force on the object in Newtons.
Force Angle: The direction of the net force in degrees.
Velocity Magnitude: The initial speed of the object in meters per second.
Velocity Angle: The direction of the objectâ€™s speed in degrees.
Static Friction: The value of the static friction coefficient. Higher values mean more friction. Value cannot be negative.
Kinetic Friction: The value of the kinetic friction coefficient. Higher values mean more friction. Value cannot be negative.

Ramp:
Height: How tall the ramp is. Can be negative to make the ramp face down.
Width: How wide the ramp is. Can be negative to make the ramp face left.
